# prime number generation algorithms

METHOD 1
--------------------
It is the naive algorithm used to generate prime numbers given between a range of two numbers and it takes more time than any other algorithms.



METHOD 2
--------------
Better algorithm relative to method 1, time complexity is less.

The program is written in javascript
inorder to run in terminal we can use node

syntax :
> node "filename.js" argument_1 argument_2 argument_3
argument_1 is the method type and the possible values are 1 & 2
argmuent_2 is the lower bound and argument_3 is th upper bound
